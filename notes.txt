GNITE:

Goals:
* Unification of information
* Access to info
* "Ed Wilson" - came up with an EOL. Problem: Deals with large data of objects. Paragraphs, pictures, etc don't work. Need to fragment into atoms, numbers, that can be analyzed.
* Deliver information at the atomic level.

Combine EOL data and IRMNG reference structure and create a fusion. GNITE is the toolkit that allows us to do that.

Complexity around different representations of the same thing: Ex: HSapiens, HomoSapiens, etc. They have accumulated these in the Global Names Index.

Sept 20, Annual taxonomist conference. Would be nice to show something.

Tasks:

* Merge two simple trees
  * I have a master tree and a reference tree. We already have the ability of copying.
  * Merging - Click on a node on the right hand, then click on a node on the left, and click on Merge. Resolve conflicts.
    * Conflicts can happen on the following:
       - Name normalization - there's a gem for this.
       - Tree path
       - Metadata - synonyms, current name
