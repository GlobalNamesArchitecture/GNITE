= parsley-store

This gem allows to dramatically increase speed of 'parsing' scientific names. 
It stores parsed strings in Redis database and does not repeat work already done

== Installation
  
  Make sure you have Redis installed on your localhost

  gem install parsley-store

== Usage

  parser = ParsleyStore.new
  parser.parse('Homo sapiens sapiens Linn. 1758')
  parser.parse('Homo sapiens sapiens Linn. 1758')

The second parse must be much faster!

To get only canonical name:

  parser.parse('Homo sapiens sapiens Linn. 1758', :canonical_only => true)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
