=== unicorn 4.0.1 - regression bugfixes / 2011-06-29 18:59 UTC

  This release fixes things for users of per-worker "listen"
  directives in the after_fork hook.  Thanks to ghazel@gmail.com
  for reporting the bug.

  The "timeout" configurator directive is now truncated to
  0x7ffffffe seconds to prevent overflow when calling
  IO.select.
