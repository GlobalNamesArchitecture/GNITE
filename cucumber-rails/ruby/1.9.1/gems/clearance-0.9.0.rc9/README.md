Bugs, Patches
-------------

Fork away and create a [Github Issue](http://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/issues).

Installation
------------

Clearance is a Rails engine. The latest stable version (0.8.8) works with versions of Rails 2.x.

Install it as a gem however you like to install gems. Also, uninstall old versions:

    sudo gem uninstall thoughtbot-clearance
    sudo gem uninstall clearance
    sudo gem install clearance

Make sure the development database exists, then run the generator:

    script/rails generate clearance

This:

* inserts Clearance::User into your User model
* inserts Clearance::Authentication into your ApplicationController
* created a migration that either creates a users table or adds only missing columns

There is a release candidate which features Rails 3 support. To install this version:

    gem install clearance --prerelease

Usage
-----

If you want to authenticate users for a controller action, use the authenticate
method in a before_filter.

    class WidgetsController < ApplicationController
      before_filter :authenticate
      def index
        @widgets = Widget.all
      end
    end

Customizing
-----------

To change any of provided actions, subclass a Clearance controller...

    class SessionsController < Clearance::SessionsController
      def new
        # my special new action
      end
      def url_after_create
        my_special_path
      end
    end

and add your route in config/routes.rb:

    resource :session, :controller => 'sessions'

See config/routes.rb for all the routes Clearance provides.

Actions that redirect (create, update, and destroy) in Clearance controllers
can be overridden by re-defining url_after_(action) methods as seen above.

Optional Cucumber features
--------------------------

As your app evolves, you want to know that authentication still works. Our
opinion is that you should test its integration with your app using
[Cucumber](http://cukes.info).

Run the Cucumber generator and Clearance feature generator:

    script/rails generate cucumber
    script/rails generate clearance_features

Edit your Gemfile to include:

    gem 'factory_girl_rails'

Edit your config/enviroments/cucumber.rb to include the following:

    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

Then run rake!

Optional Formtastic views
-------------------------

We use & recommend [Formtastic](http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic).

Clearance has another generator to generate Formastic views:

    script/rails generate clearance_views

Its implementation is designed so other view styles (Haml?) can be generated.

Authors
-------

Clearance was extracted out of [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com). We merged the
authentication code from two of thoughtbot's client Rails apps and have since
used it each time we needed authentication.
