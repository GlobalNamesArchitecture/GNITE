       kgio 2.6.0 - minor feature update and cleanups
       
       We now export SOCK_NONBLOCK, SOCK_CLOEXEC constants in the Kgio
       namespace to make kgio_tryaccept/kgio_accept easier-to-use.
       There are also some minor internal cleanups.

       add prototype for rb_thread_blocking_io_region()
       
       It's no in the public headers, but Ruby 1.9.3 will have it and
       it's still superior to rb_thread_blocking_region() even though
       it's not ideal.

       missing_accept4: don't use FD_CLOEXEC for SOCK_CLOEXEC emulation
       
       It's too confusing and may break binary compatibility if the
       system is later upgraded.

       accept.c: fix RDoc for new Kgio::SOCK_* constants
       
       We don't want people using the compatibility constants
       since they're actually broken on systems with real accept4().
   
   commit c22f2b5ebccbca8e04aa22821964f67c4a81c675

   Date:   Wed Jul 6 19:11:47 2011 -0700
   
       export SOCK_NONBLOCK, SOCK_CLOEXEC constants in Kgio
       
       It's more reliable than relying on IO::NONBLOCK and
       Fcntl::FD_CLOEXEC constants.  The existing constants are not
       guaranteed to be equivalent to what accept4() takes even
       though the current Linux implementation does it this way.

       make timed kgio_wait_* implementation safer
       
       IO.select can handle fd >= 1024 safely in some Rubies while
       fd_set may not.  We could use rb_thread_fd_select(), but
       rb_wait_for_single_fd() is available now so the former
       is not worth the maintenance hassle.

       Kgio::File includes Kgio::PipeMethods module
       
       Kgio::File may be used to open FIFOs, so non-blocking
       I/O is still useful in that context.

       Kgio::File.tryopen runs GC on ENOMEM
       
       It is possible but unlikely to get ENOMEM on open(2),
       so try to GC away some files.

       add timeout to kgio_wait_{read,writ}able
       
       io/wait doesn't have an IO#wait_writable method, yet[1]
       and IO#wait checks FIONREAD which makes it unsuitable
       for certain descriptors.
       
       This method uses the new rb_wait_for_single_fd() function in
       Ruby 1.9.r.  This internally uses ppoll() under Linux, meaning
       it performs the same regardless of the FD used.

       kgio 2.4.1 - Kgio.poll avoids EINTR, really
       
       This release fixes a race condition that could allow
       Errno::EINTR to be raised even though the 2.4.0 release
       was supposed to stop that.
       
       Nobody uses Kgio.poll, really, so this shouldn't be an issue
       for real code, yet.

       Kgio.tryopen => Kgio::File.tryopen
       
       This will allow users to subclass Kgio::File and
       override certain behavior (e.g. overriding "#each").

       return Kgio::File for Kgio.tryopen
       
       This also allows us to return/override #to_path and #path if
       necessary, but so far everything works with MRI 1.8, MRI 1.9,
       and Rubinius.
   
   commit 6cefcff5889cceaa001f76f4be1a1c5e513b241d

       add Kgio.tryopen method
       
       For the case where a file is readable, it's faster to
       just call open() instead of stat()-ing and then calling
       open().
       
       open() failures are still relatively cheap, too, they're still
       more expensive than a failed stat() but cheaper than raising
       an exception.

       == All supported platforms (*nix + MRI 1.8+, Rubinius)
       
       * OpenBSD (and possibly other *BSD) fixes, thanks to Jeremy Evans.
       
       * kgio_accept and kgio_tryaccept now take an optional second argument
         for flags (like the accept4() flags argument).
       
       == Ruby 1.9-only things
       
       * Kgio.poll no longer raises Errno::EINTR to match IO.select.
       
       == Ruby 1.9 trunk things
       
       * close() on an active FD in a different thread is better
         handled/detected.
       
       * copy-on-write for strings is properly triggered

       poll: deal with pollset changes on EINTR
       
       This allows callers to modify the pollset, interrupt
       the polling thread, and then poll with the modified
       pollset.  This is also important for dealing with
       closed IO objects that may have been invalidated
       due to GC, too.

       test_tcp_connect: disable wait_writable_set test on non-Linux
       
       OpenBSD seems to make connect() return success immediately even

       Thanks to Jeremy Evans to reporting the issue under OpenBSD.

       kgio 2.3.0 - MSG_PEEK and poll(2) support
       
       recv() with MSG_PEEK for sockets is added with the try*
       interface.  SocketMethods#kgio_trypeek and
       SocketMethods#kgio_peek or Kgio.trypeek for non-Kgio-enabled
       sockets.
       
       For Ruby 1.9 only: poll(2) is exposed via the Kgio.poll
       singleton method and should provide an alternative for IO.select
       users.
       
       Both of these new features should work well on modern Unix-like
       operating systems.

       kgio 2.2.0 - kinder, gentler I/O for the Internets
       
       * sockets accept()ed by a TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK listener
         automatically flush on kgio_*read calls if there is pending
         data.  "Kgio.autopush = false" disables this globally,
         and Kgio::Socket also get "kgio_autopush=" to enable/disable
         on a per-object individual basis.
       
       * ECONNRESET exceptions get empty backtraces for kgio_*read.
         There's nothing a programmer can do about these, so there's
         no point in going through the expensive backtrace generation
         process.
       
       * Kgio.try* singleton methods added for working with non-Kgio
         enhanced objects.  No more needing to use Object#extend
         and blowing away your method cache to make existing I/O
         objects kinder and gentler.
       
       * IPv6 support should be complete, systems without a native
         getaddrinfo(3) are now unsupported (and will remain so
         unless somebody complains).
       
       There should be no other backwards-incompatible changes other
       than requiring getaddrinfo(3) and friends for IPv6 support.

       autopush: optimize away ivar usage under MRI
       
       We know that all versions of MRI have a small RFile structure
       that is allocated in the same object slots as other Ruby types
       and also zeroed on allocation.
       
       This optimization enables us to fall back to using ivars in
       case MRI changes or if we're used on other Rubies.

       preliminary implementation of "smart_nopush"
       
       It only supports TCP_CORK under Linux right now.
       
       We use a very basic strategy to use TCP_CORK semantics optimally
       in most TCP servers:  On corked sockets, we will uncork on recv()
       if there was a previous send().  Otherwise we do not fiddle
       with TCP_CORK at all.
       
       Under Linux, we can rely on TCP_CORK being inherited in an
       accept()-ed client socket so we can avoid syscalls for each
       accept()-ed client if we already know the accept() socket corks.
       
       This module does NOTHING for client TCP sockets, we only deal
       with accept()-ed sockets right now.

       (no code changes from 2.0.0pre1)
       
       This release should make Kgio easier and more consistent

       of having default kgio_wait_readable and kgio_wait_writable

       kgio_read and kgio_tryread will now return an empty string when
       a length of zero is specified instead of nil (which would signal
       an EOF).  This emulates the behavior of IO#read, IO#readpartial,
       IO#sysread, IO#read_nonblock in core Ruby for consistency.

       kgio 1.2.0 - cleanups and minor improvements
       
       The C extension is now split into several files for
       ease-of-maintenance.
       
       Slightly more common, client-triggerable exceptions (EOFError,
       Errno::EPIPE, Errno::ECONNRESET) are now less expensive as they
       are generated without backtraces.

       generate empty backtraces for EPIPE and ECONNRESET
       
       Malicious clients may disconnect during big writes to cause
       EPIPE and ECONNRESET exceptions.  Generating backtraces can be
       expensive with Ruby, so mitigate the DoS vector by lowering the
       cost of generating an exception.

       busy servers that malicious clients may exploit to deny service.

       Make kgio_trywrite more aggressive with retrying
       
       Partial writes can be retried until completely denied with
       EAGAIN.  Often times, it is beneficial to retry immediately
       after a partial write because the kernel may allocate more
       buffers or the reader can drain the buffers.
       
       This helps the caller avoid crossing the Ruby <-> C boundary
       more than necessary.

       add kgio_tryaccept, kgio_accept _really_ blocks
       
       We'll stick with the "try" prefix if we're going to be
       non-blocking.  kgio_accept will favor a blocking accept() call
       where it's possible to release the GVL, allowing it to avoid
       thundering herd problems.  Otherwise it'll use thread-safe
       blocking under Ruby 1.8.

       use SOCK_NONBLOCK for socket(2) if possible
       
       This saves us a relatively expensive fcntl() system call.

       connect: no do not leak descriptors on failure
       
       We cannot raise exceptions and expect GC to clean up
       after us until we've created an actual IO object.

       "start" singleton methods for non-blocking connect
       
       These initiate (but do not wait for) non-blocking connects.

       introduce kgio_try* methods
       
       Avoid altering behavior based on globals that
       Kgio.wait_{read,writ}able stored in, since that's too confusing.
       The non-try variants are closer to the normal IO read/write
       methods, except they can be more easily plugged into alternate
       reactors and event frameworks.

       kgio_read returns nil on EOF
       
       Just like IO#read

       split out reusable bits into separate headers
       
       No point in cluttering up the meat of our code.

       only use MSG_DONTWAIT under Linux
       
       MSG_DONTWAIT is less consistently implemented/supported on other
       platforms on stream sockets, so fallback to fcntl() + read()/write()
       for stream sockets.  This also fixes our previously broken support
       of non-MSG_DONTWAIT systems.

       fix missing netinet/in.h include
       
       This is needed for FreeBSD 7.0, at least.

       beef up the test suite
       
       We need to test server <-> client interaction
       more thoroughly since some systems don't implement
       everything right.
