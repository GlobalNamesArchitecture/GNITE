2.3.1 (2010-05-07)
* Fix: Open state file in binary mode (http://github.com/assaf/uuid/issues#issue/8)

2.3.0 (2010-04-07)
* Added: UUID.generator returns the current UUID generator.  Particularly useful for calling
  next_sequence on the generator when forking a process.
* Added: UUID::Server and UUID::Client so you can have one process serving you UUIDs.
* Added: UUID command line tool.  Yay!

2.2.0 (2010-02-18)
* Added: set UUID.state_file = false if you cannot use a state file (e.g. shared hosting environment)

2.1.1 (2010-01-27)
* Fixed bug which caused UUID.new to fail if the state file was somehow extant but empty

2.1.0 (2009-12-16)
* Added uuid.validate -- easier to implement than explain why it's wrong.

2.0.2 (2009-06-10)
* Maintenance release. Added uuid.gemspec file in packaging, tested against
Ruby 1.9.1.

2.0.1 (2008-08-28)
* Fixed:    MAC address parses correctly when using colon as separator, not
            when using hyphen (ruby-mingw32). If your MAC address is all zero
            (check with UUID.new.inspect), remove the ruby-uuid file, and it
            will reset to the actual MAC address. (Rasha)
* Fixed:    UUID.new.inspect not showing full MAC address.

2.0.0 (2008-08-28)
* Changed:  API. UUID.generate still works as it always did, but the rest of
            the API is brand spanking new, so if you rely on anything besides
						UUID.generate, or just curious, check out the rdocs.
* Changed:  uuid.state replaced by ruby-uuid file. By default stored in
            /var/tmp, or if that path is not accessible, as .ruby-uuid in the
            home directory.
* Changed:  ruby-uuid is now stored as binary file (faster read/write), if you
            need to have a peek, open irb and type UUID.new.inspect.
* Changed:  Source code and documentation for this release hosted on the
            wonderful Github: http://github.com/assaf/uuid

1.0.4 (2007-08-28)
* Changed:  By default creates the uuid.state file in the working directory,
            not in the installation directory, which requires sudo privileges
            (e.g. gem).

1.0.3 (2006-11-08)
* Fixed:    Work around YAML bug in serializing that occurs when MAC address
            consists only of decimal digits. Credit: ebuprofen"

1.0.2 (2006-08-19)
* Changed:  Constants are not conditionally defined (removes warnings when
            using in Rails.

1.0.1 (2006-07-27)
* Added:    Regular expressions to test if a string is a UUID.
* Changed:  When used in ActiveRecord, adds as callback instead of overriding
            save.

1.0.0 (2005-11-20)
* Changed:  Separated form reliable-msg into its own package.
