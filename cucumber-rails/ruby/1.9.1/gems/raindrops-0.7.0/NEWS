=== raindrops 0.7.0 - FreeBSD fix, code cleanups / 2011-06-27 07:26 UTC

  This release fixes a build issue on FreeBSD.  There are various
  documentation and code cleanups, too.

=== raindrops 0.6.1 - fix build on non-Linux / 2011-03-21 22:31 UTC

  TCP_INFO support couldn't compile under non-Linux, this was
  broken since 0.5.0 when TCP_INFO support was introduced.

  Thanks to Ben Bleything for the report.

=== raindrops 0.6.0 - polishing up the last release / 2011-03-21 21:46 UTC

  Following up the huge 0.5.0 release, 0.6.0 makes
  some minor improvements:

  * minor UI/UX improvements for Watcher Rack app
  * set close-on-exec by default for inet_diag sockets
  * inet_diag build fixes for newer GNU libc6
  * --with-atomic_ops-dir= build option added

=== raindrops 0.5.0 - more Linux extras! / 2011-03-17 03:13 UTC

  Portable changes:
  * Raindrops are now resizable within the limits of system page size
  * Raindrops::Middleware proxies +to_path+ in response bodies
  * More documentation

  Linux-only changes:
  * Raindrops::LastDataRecv[1] Rack application
  * Raindrops::Watcher[2] Rack application
  * Raindrops::TCP_Info[3] class for capturing TCP connection stats
  * IPv6 support for inet_diag
  * faster inet_diag stats for multiple sockets

  There is also a demo server running the Watcher and Middleware
  components.  It's capped to 30 concurrent users, so go easy on
  it:

    Raindrops::Middleware: http://raindrops-demo.bogomips.org/_raindrops

=== raindrops 0.4.1 - more portability! / 2010-09-26 06:49 UTC

  Rubinius 1.1.0 support is complete.  Atomic operations
  are now available under FreeBSD 7.0 now.

  Full changelog below:

      commit 8a2a725a4ad074af493e5aa075155eda8b1d6be7
      Author: Eric Wong <e+absinthe@yhbt.net>
      Date:   Sat Sep 25 00:14:48 2010 -0700

      force -march=i486 where GCC is targeted for i386

      Nobody uses i386 anymore (especially not with Ruby!),
      but some systems like FreeBSD 7.0 still target GCC at
      i386 by default, so we force GCC to use a slightly
      more modern instruction set and allow it to use
      atomic builtins.

      commit 256cc7c8ffb441dcf2d2a2da3bbbcc82546962d9
      Author: Eric Wong <e+absinthe@yhbt.net>
      Date:   Sat Sep 25 00:01:46 2010 -0700

      disable Linux-only code on non-Linux

      This allows us to build and link correctly on FreeBSD 7.0

      commit 22a5a39d75faa890048d07ae4ea0d494acd414ce

      linux: workaround missing RSTRUCT* macros in rbx

      Struct members in the C API.

=== raindrops 0.4.0 - flowing into new systems! / 2010-09-21 22:32 UTC

  Non-GCC 4.x users may use the libatomic_ops[1] package to
  compile Raindrops.  Memory efficiency is improved for modern
  glibc users with run-time cache line size detection, we no
  longer assume 128 byte cache lines.

=== raindrops v0.3.0 - LGPL v2.1 and v3.0 / 2010-07-10 22:29 UTC

  Raindrops is now licensed under the LGPLv2.1 or LGPLv3 (from
  LGPLv3-only) to allow bundling in GPLv2-only applications.

  There are small documentation updates and updated examples
  at http://raindrops.bogomips.org/examples/

=== raindrops 0.2.0 - raining penguins! / 2010-05-05 00:35 UTC

  For servers running Unicorn 0.98.0 (and derivative servers)
  under Linux, :listeners no longer needs to be passed explicitly
  when configuring the Rack middleware.

  Some small documentation updates and cleanups, too.

=== raindrops 0.1.0 / 2010-04-08 00:45 UTC
